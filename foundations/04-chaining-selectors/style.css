/*In order tp complete this instruction we have to add an another unique classes for the first 2 images to do this
or define unique id's but let's say we can't edit thr class names and can't unique classes and id's.
In this case If we make our selector avatar the first 2 man and woman will be sharing the same class and te same
changes will apply the both
If we make our selector proportioned then avatar woman and the original woman will be exposed the same property but 
we don't want to make any changes at our original images anyway
If we make our selector distorted then avatar man and the original man will be exposed the same property but 
we don't want to make any changes at our original images anyway */

/*So we choose the chained classes to choose spesific selectors*/

/*The order of the classes shorted inside of class="" does not matter what matters is
just defining the HTML elements with spesific class selecting by chaining them with putting one after another. */
